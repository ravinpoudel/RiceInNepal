### Please complete these 2 main tasks before our first class:

 
 1. <img src="img/R_logo.png" alt="R" width = "6%"> &nbsp; Install *current* [**R**](https://cran.rstudio.com/) on your laptop
 
 2. <img src="img/Rstudio_icon.png" alt="RStudio" width = "6%"> &nbsp; Install *current* [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your laptop
 

Read below for more detailed information on installing the pieces of software we'll need, and platform specific instructions.

<br>

 
## R & RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install `R` before you install **RStudio**. Download and install both of these but in this order:

 1. [**R**](http://cran.rstudio.com/): Get the most current version version appropriate for your machine. It's free.

 2. [**RStudio**](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is a great platform to work with R (note you need R before you can use RStudio). Please install the most recent version. It's free. It does lots of cool things. We'll talk more about it in class.

### Windows


#### If you already have `R` and `RStudio` installed

* Open `RStudio`, and click on *Help* > *Check for updates*. If a new version is
	available, quit `RStudio`, and download the latest version for `RStudio`.
* To check which version of `R` you are using, start `RStudio` and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of `R` you are
  running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display
  which version of `R` you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You can [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

#### If you don't have `R` and `RStudio` installed

* Download `R` from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  XP/Vista/7/8** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### macOS


#### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open `RStudio`, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit `RStudio`, and download the latest version for `RStudio`.
* To check the version of R you are using, start `RStudio` and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of `R` you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of `R` you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it.

#### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download `R` from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest `R` version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install `R`
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install `RStudio`
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of `R` for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least `R 3.4.3`
* Go to the
  [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.
