# Brandon Hurr's Tutorial

The following code has been adapted from a great presentation Brandon gave at the D-RUG group in Oct 2017. See the original [post and content here](http://d-rug.github.io/blog/2017/Brandon-Hurr-on-using-map-and-walk)

### Load `tidyverse`

```{r setup}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

# *R* Data types

For a nice demonstration of what vectors of different data types look like, try the code below.

```{r vector intiation}
# initiate blank vectors of a specific type
# this can be useful when capturing data from for loops
a <- vector("logical", 5)
a
b <- vector("integer", 4)
b
c <- vector("double", 2) # can also use "numeric"
c
d <- vector("character", 10)
d
e <- vector("complex", 7)
e
f <- vector("raw", 3)
f
g <- list()
g
```

## `NA`'s in R

`NA`'s are a common issue in dealing with data from various places (remember spreadsheet lesson?). R deals well with NA's and even provides different NA's for different data types.

```{r NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA Batman}
#what do the NAs look like?
list(NA, NA_integer_, NA_real_, NA_character_, NA_complex_)

```

## The `NULL` element

```{r NULLs}
# NULL is the absence of a vector
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA) # logical vector 
a
a <- NULL
a

# let's use mtcars as example of making a column NULL
head(mtcars)
dim(mtcars) # how many rows, cols

# assign NULL to a given column to remove it
mtcars[1] <- NULL #this gets rid of the mpg column completely
head(mtcars)
dim(mtcars) # how many rows, cols

data(mtcars) # restore full mtcars dataset
dim(mtcars) # how many rows, cols

```

# Lists in R

Now that we have an idea what different *vectors* are, let's talk about how to make them into lists.

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PepperyMediocreAmericanbittern-small.gif)

Lists can contain anything of any length, and `data.frames` are a special type of list. 

## Vectors to Lists: dataframes & tibbles

```{r Vectors Victor, error = TRUE}
# let's put actual values into these
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA) # a logical vector 6 items long
b <- c(1:7, NA_integer_) # Integers
c <- c(rnorm(8), NA_real_) # pull doubles from normal distribution
d <- c(LETTERS[1:3], NA_character_) # first 3 capital letters

e <- list(a, b, c, d) #make a list

e # check it

# Lists can contain anything of any length
## data.frame is a special type of list
## data.frame rows imply association so they need to line up

data.frame(a, b) # uh oh

a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, NA, NA) # make it 8 like b
df <- data.frame(a = a, b = b) 
df 
```

`tibbles` are data.frames with some stricter rules: 
  - slightly more informative printing (not shown well here)
  - strict behavior around subsetting `[` -> tibble `[[` vector
  - does not partially match column names (b/c this can get you into trouble)

```{r}
as_tibble(df)
```

_**See presentation, SLIDE: **_

## Accessing elements inside vectors, lists, dataframes, and tibbles

``` {r list_df_tibble_subsetting, error = TRUE} 

#atomic vectors
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA) #logic vector 
a
a[1] 
a[[1]] # does the same thing
a[[[1]]] # nope just stop adding brackets!

# lists
list_example <- list(a = a, b = b, c = c, d = d, e = list(1, "A")) #make a named list
list_example
# single brackets returns a list with that element in it
# can reference by location or by name
list_example[1]
list_example["a"]

# double brackets return a vector 
list_example[[2]]
list_example[["b"]]

#stack [['s to peel the onion back
list_example[["e"]] # remove one layer
list_example[["e"]][[2]] # remove the second layer (access e list, and 2 item in that list)

#dolla dolla bills y'all (works like [[, with named vectors)
list_example$c

#same for dataframes
mtcars[1]
mtcars[[1]]

# and for tibbles
tbbl <- tibble(x = 1:3, y = LETTERS[1:3])
tbbl[1]
tbbl["x"]

tbbl[[2]]
tbbl[["y"]]
```

# Functions and `for` Loops

## Functions

When should we make a function in R? 

```{r Y_make_a_function}
#Simple dataframe
df <- data.frame(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
# What are we doing here?
df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Anytime we need to do the same thing 3 or more times, it would probably be a good idea to think about creating a function. Stepping through these pieces, here's what we'd want to do:

First what is the calculation/task you want to do?

```{r function01, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))
# exactly as above
```

Now pull out the common components:

```{r function02, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# pull out what's common
x <- (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Problem is the above isn't a function yet, it's just the "anonymous" calculation we want our function to follow. We can simplify even more if we want:

```{r function03, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# simplify more and refactor if that makes sense
x <- (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

And now add the actual `function()` call!

```{r function04, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
rescale_0_1 <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```

Let's test this function and see what happens. We can test a single vector, and then actually apply our function to each column in our dataset. Use a test dataset that's simple and we now what it should look like.

```{r test function, eval=T, echo=T}

rescale_0_1 <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

testvec <- 10:20 # so this should get rescaled from 0 to 1
testvec
rescale_0_1(testvec) # looks like it worked, it rescaled all values from 0 to 1!

```

```{r use_function, eval=T, echo=T}
df <- data.frame(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
rescale_0_1 <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

out <- df # rename df so we can always come back
out$a <- rescale_0_1(df$a)
out$b <- rescale_0_1(df$b)
out$c <- rescale_0_1(df$c)
out$d <- rescale_0_1(df$d)
out
```

## `for` Loops to *apply* a function

Reduce iteration with a `for` loop, which takes a vector or list, and interates or steps through each piece of that vector/list, does something and returns values/data.

```{r forloops}

out <- df #make a copy to store scaled data
for (i in 1:ncol(df)) { # loop through each element
  out[i] <- rescale_0_1(df[[i]]) #apply function and store it to out
}
out

```

### Using `seq_along`

Handy command that sequences along a list for you, so you don't have to specify columns or rows, or series of numbers.

```{r for_seq_along_loops, eval=T, echo=T}
out <- df #make a copy to store scaled data
for (i in seq_along(df)) {
  out[i] <- rescale_0_1(df[[i]])
}
out
```

# `map` and `apply` Functions

There are a family of functions called `apply` (`mapply`, `sapply`, `lapply`, `vapply`) which essentially take a list of something and *apply* a function or operation on each item in that list. These are base functions in R, but a newer set of functions (which do the same thing & more) have been written in R, called the `map` functions. Let's see how they migth work.

## `apply` 

```{r apply_function, eval=T, echo=T}

df_app1 <- apply(df, MARGIN = 2, function(x) rescale_0_1(x)) # iterate over the columns in df
class(df_app1) # returns a matrix

df_app2 <- sapply(df, function(x) rescale_0_1(x)) # same as above but defaults to cols

```

Okay so `apply` returns a matrix. What about `map`?

## `map`

```{r MAPGIC, eval=F, echo=T}

library(purrr)

df_map1<- map(df, function(x) rescale_0_1(x)) #map over the columns in df

class(df_map1) # returns a list! Keeps same format that was input

df_map2 <- map_df(df, rescale_0_1) # returns a dataframe!

```

Let's look at another more simple example.

### Specifying Outputs with `map`

Another set of examples below will help us understand how `map` makes it easy to get different data classes (`matrix`,`list`, `dataframe`) back out. The default `map` function takes a list and returns a list, but there are various options that allow you to specify what you want.

This example creates a list containing two integer vectors. Let's say we want the mean of each one:

```{r simplemap, eval=F, echo=T}

l = list(a=1:10, b = 10:100)
map(l, function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) # and this is returning a list (list in, list out)

```

#### Get numeric `double` type back

Specify and you get a vector back instead of a list

```{r rightmap, eval=F, echo=T}

l = list(a=1:10, b = 10:100)
map_dbl(l, function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) # this is a numeric vector

```

#### Get `character` back

Maybe not so useful, but demonstrates the point.

```{r okishmap, eval=F, echo=T}

map_chr(l, function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))

```

### Use Error Messages: Type-strict functions

So if you have or try to use the wrong type of data, the function won't run. 

```{r wrongmap, error = TRUE, eval=F, echo=T}
l = list(a=1:10, b = 10:100)
map_lgl(l, function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# More `map` Examples

## `map` Use Case #1: Read in files

Based upon this tutorial
http://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-the-purrr-package-in-r/

```{r simple_read_csvs, message = FALSE, eval=F, echo=T}

# this will work if you clone the github repository
fileloc <- file.path(getwd(), "stocks")
#create a list of files to read in that end in csv
files <- list.files(fileloc, pattern = "csv$", full.names = TRUE) 

#this reads in each csv independently into a list
dat2 <- map(files, read_csv)
dat2

```

### Let's make it a function

```{r make_it_functional, message = FALSE, eval=F, echo=T}

fileloc <- file.path(getwd(), "stocks")

read_folder <- function(folder) {
  # get files that end with csv or CSV
  files <- list.files(folder, pattern = "(csv|CSV)$", full.names = TRUE) 
  #this reads in each csv independently into a list
  map(files, read_csv) # last thing is returned
}

read_folder(fileloc)
```


#### What if you want to change the type of file you're reading?

```{r fancify, message = FALSE, eval=F, echo=T}

fileloc <- file.path(getwd(), "stocks")

read_folder <- function(folder, pattern, read_fun) {
  # get files that end with csv or CSV
  files <- list.files(folder, pattern = pattern, full.names = TRUE) 
  #this reads in each csv independently into a list
  map(files, read_fun)
}

read_folder(folder = fileloc, pattern = "(csv|CSV)$", read_fun = read_csv)
# OR more succinctly
# read_folder(fileloc, "(csv|CSV)$", read_csv)

```

#### Combine Files and Label By Filenames

If there are multiple files but all have same structure (same number of columns/column types), we can read in separately and then combine. But add the filename of each dataset as a new column variable.

```{r combinify, message = FALSE, eval=F, echo=T}

fileloc <- file.path(getwd(), "stocks")

# This function reads a file and appends a column called "name" for ID
read_fun <- function(file, FUN) {
		dat <- FUN(file) # read in file
		dat$name <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(file)) #record the filename for later grouping
		dat #bring data back
  }

# This function reads a folder for files of given pattern
# then applies the given read function to read them in read_fun
read_files_bind <- 	function(folder, pattern, FUN) {
    # get files that end with csv or CSV
    files <- list.files(folder, pattern = pattern, full.names = TRUE) 
    map_dfr(files, read_fun, FUN)
  }

# Read everything in at once and bind it all together
read_files_bind(folder = fileloc, pattern = "(csv|CSV)$", FUN = read_csv)

```

# Lists & List columns

Ok, so we can get data into our environment in a list, but what then? There are a number of ways to deal with these data, or to deal with lists within dataframes...called *list columns*.

## `tidyr::nest()` embeds tibbles in a column

See how to group by something and then create a list-columns that hold each dataframe for that group.

```{r nesting, eval=T, echo=T}

cars_nested <-
  mtcars %>%            # motortrend car dataset
    group_by(cyl) %>%   # group by cylinder
    nest(.key = "data") # nest data by cyl, default key is "data"

cars_nested

```  
  
## Interacting with list-data using `map`

Use `map`!. Let's make a linear model for each subset, pull out the coefficients with `broom`, and plot them.

```{r model_extracts, eval=F, echo=T}

library(broom)
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

mtc_modeled <- 
  mtcars %>%            # motortrend car dataset
    group_by(cyl) %>%   # group by cylinder
    nest(.key = "data") %>%         # nest data by cyl, default key is "data"
    mutate(model = map(data, ~ lm(mpg ~ disp, data = .x))) %>%  # make models
    mutate(coeff = map(model, tidy)) %>%                        #pull out coefficients
    mutate(slope = map_dbl(coeff, ~ pull(.x, estimate)[2])) %>% # pull slope from coefficients
    mutate(intercept = map_dbl(coeff, ~ pull(.x, estimate)[1])) # pull intercept from coefficients
  
 
ggplot() +
  # plot the original data 
  geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  # plot the models
  geom_abline(data = mtc_modeled, aes(slope = slope, intercept = intercept, color = as.factor(cyl)))
  
```

## Iterating over more than one list with `map2` and `pmap`

```{r map2_pmap_usage example, eval=F, echo=T}

n =  list(5,10,20)
mu = list(50,30,10)
sd = list(10,5,1)

# how does it look as we go from map to map2 to pmap?
map(n, rnorm)
map2(n, mu, rnorm)
pmap(list(n, mu, sd), rnorm)

#technically, pmap can do it all
pmap(list(n), rnorm)
pmap(list(n, mu), rnorm)

# formula interface
map(n, ~rnorm(.))
map2(n, mu, ~ rnorm(.x, .y))
pmap(list(n, mu, sd), ~rnorm(..1, ..2, ..3)) # ..4 and so on for as many as you need

# CAUTION: position matters with map2 & pmap
map2(n, mu, rnorm)
map2(mu, n, rnorm)
pmap(list(n, mu, sd), rnorm)
pmap(list(mu, n, sd), rnorm)

# if you need non-default ordering, specify with full function call
map2(mu, n, function(x, y) rnorm(y, x))
# or using the formula interface
map2(mu, n, ~ rnorm(.y, .x))

# pmap you can name your list to get around positional ordering
pmap(list(mean=mu, n=n, sd=sd), rnorm)
# OR you can specify with a full function call
pmap(list(mu, n, sd), function(mu, n, sd) rnorm(n, mu, sd))
# OR with the formula interface
pmap(list(mu, n, sd), ~ rnorm(..2, ..1, ..3))

```

## `walk/walk2/pwalk` are used to output side-effects

```{r simple walk, eval=F, echo=T}
asdf <- list(a = LETTERS[1:10], b = 1:15, c = FALSE)
# we just want to print each element of this list
walk(asdf, print)
```

### Outputting Plots with `map` Functions

```{r walking_to_plotting, eval=F, echo=T}
# make a simple plotting function
plot_points <- function(t) ggplot(t, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()

mtcars %>%                 # motortrend car dataset
  group_by(cyl) %>%       # group by cylinder
  nest(.key = "data") %>% # nest by cylinder
  mutate(plot = map(data, plot_points)) %>% # we made a graph for each subset
  pull(plot) %>% #pull the plots out as a list
  walk(., print) # print them

```

#### Save Plots from `walk` with `walk2/pwalk`

```{r walk2_saving_plots, eval=F, echo=T}
# make a simple plotting function
plot_points <- function(t) ggplot(t, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()

mtc_plot_n_save <-
  mtcars %>%                 # motortrend car dataset
    group_by(cyl) %>%       # group by cylinder
    nest(.key = "data") %>% # nest by cylinder
    mutate(plot = map(data, plot_points)) %>% # we made a graph for each subset
    mutate(filepath = map_chr(cyl, ~ file.path("figures", paste0(.x, ".png")))) #make the save paths


walk2(mtc_plot_n_save$plot, mtc_plot_n_save$filepath, ~ ggsave(.y, .x)) # save them out

```

That is great! Ok, let's make this a bit fancier. With `pwalk` we can have a bunch of different lists of things that get mapped...not just 1 or 2.

```{r pwalk_output_all_the_things, eval=F, echo=T}

# make a simple plotting function
plot_points <- function(t) ggplot(t, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()

#function that prints cylinder info, ggplot, and table 
print_func <-
  function(info, plot, table, filepath) {
    print(paste0("This is for ", info, " cylinders./n"))
    print(plot)
    ggsave(filepath)
    print(table)
    
  }

mtc_plot_n_save <-
  mtcars %>%                 # motortrend car dataset
    group_by(cyl) %>%       # group by cylinder
    nest(.key = "data") %>% # nest by cylinder
    mutate(plot = map(data, plot_points)) %>% # we made a graph for each subset
    mutate(filepath = map_chr(cyl, ~ file.path("figures", paste0(.x, ".png")))) # make the save paths

# print all the info
pwalk(list(info = mtc_plot_n_save$cyl, plot = mtc_plot_n_save$plot, table = mtc_plot_n_save$data, filepath = mtc_plot_n_save$filepath), print_func) 
```
