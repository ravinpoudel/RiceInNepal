# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,
especially for complicated operations. Enter **`dplyr`**. **`dplyr`** is a package for
making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`,
come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you
should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. You should
already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an
"umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which
work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 major problems with some of base R functions:
1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.
2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware of.

To load the package type:


```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")    ## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
```

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation
tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks
optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the
ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of
doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database,
queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are
returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted
in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you
can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull
back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups - like plots or aquaria. Moving back and forth between these formats is nontrivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools for this and more sophisticated  data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this
[handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`, the base function for reading in data. The data we are going to be using today should already be in your R_DAVIS_2020 project in the folder `data`. 

```{r,results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

## inspect the data
str(surveys)
```

Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`
This is referred to as a "tibble".
Tibbles are almost identical to R's standard data frames, but they tweak some of the old behaviors of data frames. For our purposes the only differences between data frames
and tibbles are that:

1. When you print a tibble, R displays the data type of each column under its name; it prints only the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit
on one screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never automatically converted into factors.

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions: `select()`,
`filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `join`. To select columns of a
data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data
frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent arguments are the **columns** to keep.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To choose **rows** based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

`select` is used for **rows** and `filter` is used for **columns**.

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option is **`pipes`**. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful
when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like
`%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically
with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + 
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then through `select()`
to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes
the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on
its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument
to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter`ed
for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species_id`, `sex`,
and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple,
but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Challenge 
Using pipes, subset the `surveys` data to include individuals collected before
1995 and retain only the columns `year`, `sex`, and `weight`. Name this dataframe `surveys_challenge`

<details>
<summary>ANSWER</summary>
```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys_challenge <- surveys %>%
    filter(year < 1995) %>%
    select(year, sex, weight)
```
</details>
</div>
<br>

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_kg2 = weight_kg * 2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you
can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-**`dplyr`**
functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or `magrittr` package is loaded).

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove
those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`. The `!`
symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where weight *is not* an `NA`.

<div class = "blue">
### Challenge

Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the following
criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a new column called
`hindfoot_half` containing values that are half the `hindfoot_length` values.
In this `hindfoot_half` column, there are no `NA`s and all values are less
than 30. Name this data frame `surveys_hindfoot_half`.

**Hint**: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

<details>
<summary>ANSWER</summary>
```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}

surveys_hindfoot_half <- surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length / 2) %>%
    filter(hindfoot_half < 30) %>%
    select(species_id, hindfoot_half)
```
</details>
</div>

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run off the
screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

When grouping both by `sex` and `species_id`, the first rows are for individuals
that escaped before their sex could be determined and weighted. You may notice
that the last column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which refers to "Not a
Number"). To avoid this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we
attempt to calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing
values are removed first, we can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn't run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to
display:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

<div class = "blue">
### Challenge

1. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot
length for each species (using `species_id`).
2. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`,
`genus`, `species_id`, and `weight`.
3. You saw above how to count the number of individuals of each `sex` using a
combination of `group_by()` and `tally()`. How could you get the same result
using `group_by()` and `summarize()`? Hint: see `?n`.

<details>
<summary>ANSWER</summary>
```{r, purl=FALSE}
## Answer 1
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    group_by(species_id) %>%

        mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
        min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
        max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length)
    )

## Answer 2
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(weight == max(weight)) %>%
    select(year, genus, species, weight) %>%
    arrange(year)

## Answer 3
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

### Joining two dataframes together using `join` functions

Often when working with real data, data might be seperated in multiple .csvs. The `join` family of dplyr functions can accomplish the task of uniting disperate data frames together rather easily. There are many kind of `join` functions that dplyr offers, and today we are going to cover the most commonly used function `left_join`. 

To learn more about the `join` family of functions, check out this [useful link](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html). 

Let's read in another dataset. This data set is a record of the tail length of every rodent in our `surveys` dataframe. For some annoying reason, it was recorded on a seperate data sheet. We want to take the tail length data and add it to our surveys dataframe. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
tail <- read_csv("data/tail_length.csv")
```

The `join` functions join dataframes together based on shared columns between the two data frames. Luckily, both our `surveys` dataframe and our new `tail_length` data frame both have the column `record_id`. Let's double check that our record_id columns in the two data frames are the same by using the `summary` function. 

```{r}
summary(surveys$record_id) #just summarize the record_id column by using the $ operator 

summary(tail$record_id)
```

Looks like all those values are identical. Awesome! Let's join the dataframes together. 

The basic structure of a `join` looks like this:

`join_type(FirstTable, SecondTable, by=columnTojoinBy)`

#### There are many different kinds of join types:

- `inner_join` will return all the rows from Table A that has *matching values* in Table B, and all the columns from both Table A and B

- `left_join` returns all the rows from Table A with all the columns from both A and B. Rows in Table A that have no match in Table B will return NAs

- `right_join` returns all the rows from Table B and all the columns from table A and B. Rows in Table B that have no match in Table A will return NAs. 

- `full_join` returns all the rows and all the columns from Table A and Table B. Where there are no matching values, returns NA for the one that is missing. 

For our data we are going to use a `left_join`. We want all the rows from the `survey` data frame, and we want all the columns from both data frames to be in our new data frame. 

```{r}

surveys_joined <- left_join(surveys, tail, by = "record_id")

```

If we don't include the `by = ` argument, the default is to join by all the variables with common names across the two data frames. 

We could also add our tail data to a dataframe that you create within your R project. Let's say we were just interested in adding the tail length data to the species "NL". 

First, we have to create a dataframe that just has species = NL, and then we have to join that data frame with our `tail` dataframe.

```{r}
NL_data <- surveys %>% 
  filter(species_id == "NL") #filter to just the species NL

NL_data <- left_join(NL_data, tail, by = "record_id") #a new column called tail_length was added
```

As you can see, even with a lot of `record_id` missing, the `left_join` function will still join the dataframes together based on shared values. 

### Reshaping with pivot_longer and pivot_wider

In the 
<span style="background:yellow">[spreadsheet lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data/)</span> we discussed how to 
structure our data leading to the four rules defining a tidy dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a table.

In `surveys` , the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables associated
with each record (the unit), values such the weight or sex of each animal 
associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we 
wanted to compare the different mean weight of each species between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprise of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values
of the species in `genus` would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore the 
relationship between the weight of different species within, and between, the
plots. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure,
but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest:
average species weight per plot instead of recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of
a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two new `tidyr` functions, `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

#### `pivot_wider`

`pivot_wider()` widens data by *increasing* the number of columns and *decreasing* the number of rows. It takes three main arguments:

1. the data
2. `names_from` the name of the column you'd like to spread out
3. `values_from` the data you want to fill all your new columns with 

Let's try an example using our surveys data frame. Let's pretend we are interested in what the mean weight is for each species in each plot. How would we create a dataframe that would tell us that information? 

First, we need to calculate the mean weight for each species in each plot:
```{r}
surveys_mz <- surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(genus, plot_id) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) 

str(surveys_mz) #let's take a look at the data

```
In `surveys_mz` there are 196 rows and 3 columns. Using `pivot_wider` we are going to *increase* the number of columns and *decrease* the number of rows. We want each row to signify a single genus, with their mean weight listed for each plot id. How many rows do we want our final data frame to have?

```{r}

unique(surveys_mz$genus) #lists every unique genus in surveys_mz

n_distinct(surveys_mz$genus) #another way to look at the number of distinct genera

```
There are 10 unique genera, so we want to create a data frame with just 10 rows. How many columns would we want? Since we want each column to be a distinct plot id, our number of columns should equal our number of plot ids. 
```{r}
n_distinct(surveys_mz$plot_id)
```
Alright, so we want a data frame with 10 rows and 24 columns. `pivot_wider` can do the job! 
```{r}
wide_survey <- surveys_mz %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "plot_id", values_from =  "mean_weight")

head(wide_survey)
```

#### `pivot_longer`

`pivot_longer` lengthens data by *increasing* the number of rows and *decreasing* the number of columns. This function takes 4 main arguments: 

1. the data 
2. `cols`, the column(s) to be pivoted (or to ignore)
3. `names_to` the name of the new column you'll create to put the column names in
4. `values_to` the name of the new column to put the column values in

![pivot_longer figure](img/pivot_longer.JPG)

Let's pretend that we got sent the dataset we just created (`wide_survey`) and we want to reshape it to be in a long format. We can easily do that using `pivot_longer`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
#cols = columns to be pivoted. Here we want to pivot all the plot_id columns, except the colum "genus"
#names_to = the name of the new column we created from the `cols` argument 
#values_to = the name of the new column we will put our values in

surveys_long <- wide_survey %>% pivot_longer(col = -genus, names_to = "plot_id", values_to = "mean_weight")

```
This data set should look just like `surveys_mz`. But this one is 240 rows, and `surveys_mz` is 196 rows. What's going on? 

```{r}
View(surveys_long)
```

Looks like all the NAs are included in this data set. This is always going to happen when moving between `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`, but is actually a useful way to balance out a dataset so every replicate has the same composition.  Luckily, we now know how to remove the NAs if we want! 
```{r}
surveys_long <- surveys_long %>% 
  filter(!is.na(mean_weight)) #now 196 rows
```

`pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` are both new additions to the `tidyverse` which means there are some cool new blog posts detailing all their abilities. If you'd like to read more about this group of functions, check out these links:

### Challenge

1. Use `pivot_wider` on the `surveys` data frame with `year` as columns, `plot_id` as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before
  reshaping, and use the function `n_distinct()` to get the number of unique
  genera within a particular chunk of data. It's a powerful function! See `?n_distinct` for more.
2. The `surveys` data set has two measurement columns: `hindfoot_length` and `weight`.  This makes it
   difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of
   each measurement per year in different plot types. Let's walk through a
   common solution for this type of problem. First, use `pivot_longer()` to create a
    dataset where we have a new column called `measurement` and a
   `value` column that takes on the value of either `hindfoot_length` or
   `weight`. *Hint*: You'll need to specify which columns are being selected to make longer.
3. With this new data set, calculate the average of each
   `measurement` in each `year` for each different `plot_type`. Then
   use `pivot_wider()` to get them into a data set with a column for `hindfoot_length` and
   `weight`. *Hint*: You only need to specify the `names_from =` and `values_from =`
    columns
