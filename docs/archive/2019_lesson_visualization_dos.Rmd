title: "Visualization Dos & Don'ts"
---

<br> 

Visualization is a critical piece of our job as researchers. We need to communicate our findings to our peers, the public, and beyond. Bear in mind that humans are very visual---we process images 60,000 times faster than text, and nearly 90% of all the information transmitted to our brains is [visual](http://news.mit.edu/2014/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116)---so typically people remember far more of what they <font color="#DAAA00">**see**</font> versus what they **read**. Especially if that happens to be a well-designed, concise visualization of a pattern or trend. We like stories, so try to tell a story with your figure and make it stand alone.

## Historical Data Visualization

Data visualization is not new. There have been many amazing maps and visualizations through the centuries. One of the common examples you may run across is [Charle's Minard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard) map of the effect of temperature on Napoleon's invaision of Russia through time. It packs 6 different types of data into one plot (distance, lat, lon, directionality, temperature, and dates). This type of plot later became known as a "Sankey plot", and is still commonly used.

Another set of great examples includes Florence Nightingale's coxcomb charts (1854) depicting the effect of disease on mortality of troops. It's basically a fancy polar-diagram showing the timing of deaths (preventable) from disease in blue, and from wounds and other causes in red and black.

Another example is John Snow's (no, not "winter is coming") [dot maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) of cholera deaths in relation to the origin of drinking water sources were critical in founding the field of epidemiology.

## Data Visualization in R

There are many tips and tricks that are available for the multitude of visualization packages in R. However, there aren't as many simple rules or suggestions on what actually makes a good visualization. This starts with the "grammar of graphics", which is the fundamental rules or principals which describe an art or science (from Wickham 2010).

 > "A good grammar will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978)"
 
Because there are so many options and methods to plot our data in R, we need to think about how we are going to represent the data, how can that data be interpreted visually, and what story it may tell.

A very nice example of this is provided by this animation (created by Darkhorse Analytics, and used in Jenny Bryan's excellent [stat545](http://stat545.com/block015_graph-dos-donts.html) course). It shows how *simplification* can make a big difference in communication.

### Exploration vs. Communication

One thing to consider is what the objective is when creating a visualization or plot. When we build plots for exploratory purposes, we already know what the variables are we are using, and the objective is more about what sort of patterns the data might show. When communicating, the objective is more about providing a stand-alone snapshot which helps others *understand* what you are trying to convey. We'll cover more on this when we talk about `Rmarkdown`.

### `ggplot2`

While there are many visualization options in R, I believe the most comprehensive and powerful is the `ggplot2` package. Much of the class has used/follows `ggplot`, so here's a little background that might be useful.

 - Based on Grammar of Graphics book by Leland Wilkinson hence ‘gg’
 - Each part of the plot is layered or built upon the other parts (like building legos).
 - Consider parts of a `ggplot2` as parts of a house.
    - Data = The materials the house is built from (`ggplot(data=yourdata)`)
    - Plot Type = The structure/design of your house (how will it look?) (`geom_`)
    - Aesthetics = What the exterior looks like, i.e., the paint/decor (`aes()`)
    - Stats = Ways to wire or plumb your house...how to tie your data together, or transform it (`stat_`)

## Color!!

There are so many options in R. It is fun to play around with color, but keep in mind not everyone sees color in the same way, and some folks cannot see certain spectrums of color (i.e., [absence of blue or green receptors is common](https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-vision/what-is-color-blindness)). See below for a example of what colorblindness may do...if you see numbers inside these circles, great, you have some blue/green retinal receptors.

![](https://www.colormatters.com/images/cbtests/plate1.jpg) ![](https://www.colormatters.com/images/cbtests/plate3.jpg)

Having said that, [here's a great cheat sheet of colors in R](http://research.stowers.org/mcm/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorChart.pdf), it can be handy when trying to find the correct color or name of a color. 

### Discrete/Categorical:

For a very nice discussion about color palettes, I recommend [this page](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/) from the R cookbook folks. 

Additionally, check out the great [ggthemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html) package, which has many options. One I find very helpful is using `scale_color_colorblind()`, which if you have 8-9 categories, may be a nice way to display your data.

### Continuous: [`viridis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)

The `viridis` package is an excellent set of colors that better represent your data, are easier to read for those with colorblindness, and they also tend to print fairly well in grayscale.

Take a look at the [vignette online](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)!

An example:

## Visualization Tips {.tabset .tabset-fade}

This information isn't meant to be comprehensive, but at minimum, it may provide some guidance when you are creating plots and figures. 

### Visualization Do's

The most basic tip is keep it simple! Stick with a clean and clear message, what is your plot/figure trying to get across? Data visualization is effective when it is simple, and repackages data into a visual story that is easy to understand. 

 - Label appropriately and legibly, including axes, and use text to highlight important bits
 - Use one color to represent each category, consider colorblind/BW friendly palettes
 - Order datasets using logical heirarchy (Make it easy for reader to compare values)
 - Use icons when possible to reduce unnecessary labeling
 - Pay attention to scale (e.g., start axis at zero not 2.4 to 3.5)
 - Include your data/outliers where possible


### Visualization Don'ts

A few things to avoid (which basically relates to keeping it simple):

 - Don't try to add too much into one plot...**keep it simple**
 - Don't add color uncessarily unless it provides a specific function
 - Avoid high contrast colors (red/green or blue/yellow)
 - Don't use 3D charts. They can make it hard to discern or perceive the actual information.
 - Avoid ornamentation (shadowing, extra illustration, etc)
 - Avoid more than 6 categorical colors in a layout unless you looking at continuous data.
 - Keep fonts simple (avoid uncessary **bold** or *italicization*)
 - Don't try to compare too many categories or data types in one chart
 
### Examples

#### Scatterplots

One of the best simple plots for examining patterns in data, but very effective. Also used when adding model trend lines.

```{r scatterplots}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
plot(x=iris$Petal.Width) # single variable
plot(x=iris$Petal.Width, y=iris$Petal.Length) # multiple variables
ggplot() + geom_point(data=iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length))
ggplot() + geom_point(data=iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length, fill=Species), pch=21, size=3, alpha=0.5)

```


#### Lineplots

Comparing relative change in quantities across a variable like time. Note the change when we avoid facetting each line independently.

```{r lineplots}
plot(EuStockMarkets)

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
EuStockMarkets_df <- data.frame(as.matrix(EuStockMarkets), date=as.numeric(time(EuStockMarkets)))
EuStockMarkets_long <- gather(data = EuStockMarkets_df, key = "Market", value="value", 1:4)
ggplot() + geom_line(data=EuStockMarkets_long, aes(x=date, y=value, color=Market))

```

#### Barplots

Comparing totals across multiple groups. Notice legibility when you stack the bars.

```{r barplots}

# code adpated from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/guide-data-visualization-r/
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(viridis))
barplot(iris$Petal.Length)
barplot(iris$Sepal.Length,col  = viridis(3, option = "A")) 
barplot(table(iris$Species,iris$Sepal.Length),col  = viridis(3, option = "A")) 
```

#### Hexbins

This isn't as commonly used, but binning data is an effective way to represent lots of pieces. Hexbins are effectively just histograms.

```{r hexbins}

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(hexbin);
  library(viridis);
  library(ggplot2)
})

a=hexbin(diamonds$price,diamonds$carat,xbins=40)
plot(a)

ggplot() + geom_hex(data=diamonds, aes(x=price, y=carat), bins=40) + 
  scale_fill_viridis()

```

## Publishing Plots: `cowplot`

A few excellent options exist for creating multi-paneled plots for publications. The first and foremost is a package by Claus Wilke called [`cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html). With `cowplot`, it's possible to quickly combine existing `ggplots`, creating publication quality plots. See the vignette for more options, but here's a quick example from the vignette below:

```{r cowplot, echo=T, eval=T}

library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

# make a few plots:
plot.diamonds <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill = cut)) + geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=70, vjust=0.5))
#plot.diamonds

plot.cars <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) + 
   geom_point(size = 2.5)
#plot.cars

plot.iris <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, fill=Species)) +
  geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7, shape=21)
#plot.iris

# use plot_grid
(panel_plot <- plot_grid(plot.cars, plot.iris, plot.diamonds, labels=c("A", "B", "C"), ncol=2, nrow = 2))

# fix the sizes draw_plot
(fixed_gridplot <- ggdraw() + draw_plot(plot.iris, x = 0, y = 0, width = 1, height = 0.5) +
           draw_plot(plot.cars, x=0, y=.5, width=0.5, height = 0.5) +
           draw_plot(plot.diamonds, x=0.5, y=0.5, width=0.5, height = 0.5) + 
  draw_plot_label(label = c("A","B","C"), x = c(0, 0.5, 0), y = c(1, 1, 0.5)))
```

Saving out plots with `save_plot` can be a good way to preserve or change the aspect ratio. See how changing the aspect ratio changes the output:


```{r, cowplotSave, eval=F, echo=T}

# save_plot can be a nice way to set the aspect_ratio...play with these options
save_plot("figures/plot2by1_11.png", fixed_gridplot, dpi=300,
          ncol = 2, # we're saving a grid plot of 2 columns
          nrow = 2, # and 2 rows
          # each individual subplot should have an aspect ratio of 1.3
          base_aspect_ratio = 1.1
          )

```

**Ratio of 1.1**: 

![ratio1.1](figures/plot2by1_11.png)

**Ratio of 1.5**
![ratio1.5](figures/plot2by1_15.png)

## Publishing Plots: `patchwork`

A newer package (only available only via Github) by Thomas Pedersen is called `patchwork`. To install, you'll need a package called "`devtools`". See the [`patchwork` github page](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) section on installation for more info. The terminology used for plots is based on ggplot2, so it uses the `+` between things. Now, you can simply add your plots together using this terminology. Note, this doesn't have the same lettering functionality shown above, but does make it easier to arrange your plots however you choose. Using the plots from our example above:

```{r patchwork, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
#devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
library(patchwork)

# the default
plot.cars + plot.iris + plot.diamonds + plot_layout(ncol=1)

# you can use a few different things to nest your plots by changin "+" to "-"
plot.cars + plot.iris - plot.diamonds + plot_layout(ncol=1)

# there are many more options should you choose them, see the github page.

```
