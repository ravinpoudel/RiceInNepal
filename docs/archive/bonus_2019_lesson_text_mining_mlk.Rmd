title: Analyzing Text in R
minutes: 75
---

There are many kinds of data, including text! We can read text into R just like any other type of data, and using a number of handy packages, we can extract and parse out words, sentences, etc. Once the data has been "de-constructed", it's much easier to analyze and visualize our text.

Let's learn about doing text mining with R. This is going to be a very short demo using the "I have a dream" speech by Martin Luther King Jr. There is a much more comprehensive and excellent resource for working with text in R, ["Text Mining with R" by Julia Silge and David Robinson](http://tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html). We'll reference a few chapters from this book in this lesson.

## Text Mining Packages in R

There are always more packages that appear on CRAN, but the main libraries we'll want for this pipeline are:

 - `dplyr` 
 - `tidytext`
 
An optional package that is fun to play with is `gutenbergr`, which provides access to public domain works from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) collection.
 

```{r libraries, echo=F, eval=T}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(dplyr);
  library(tidytext);
  library(gutenbergr)
})

```

## Tidying Text

Let's read [**Ch. 1 of Text Mining in R**](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html#contrasting-tidy-text-with-other-data-structures) for some more info on character vectors in R. This code is taken from Ch 1 (Silge & Robinson 2017).

```{r text example, echo=TRUE}

# basic text from Emily Dickinson
text <- c("Because I could not stop for Death -",
          "He kindly stopped for me -",
          "The Carriage held but just Ourselves -",
          "and Immortality")

# make it into a dataframe
text_df <- data_frame(line = 1:4, text = text)

```


 > **What is a token?**
 
 > **What is tokenization?**

### Tokenization of Text

Let's break these chunks of text into individual pieces, or *tokens*. 

```{r tokenize}

# now extract the individual words
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

```

Once we are able to parse the pieces of text out into individual components, it's easier to use a standard analysis pipeline similar to Hadley Wickham's "`Import > Tidy > Transform/Visualize/Model > Communicate`". 

This figure (from Silge and Robinson, 2017) gives a nice overview of the process of text mining/analysis.

### Jane Austen Example

For a nice example, let's check out the Jane Austen text tidying code from [Ch 1.3 of Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html#tidyausten).

### Analysis of "I Have a Dream" (MLK Jr.)

Let's assess Martin Luther King Jr.'s "*I Have A Dream*" and identify the most commonly used words. The data file for this is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gge-ucd/R-DAVIS/master/data/I_have_a_dream_1963.md), you'll need to make sure you download to a "data" folder within your project. Also, make sure you have the `readr` and `ggplot2` packages installed.

```{r mlk, echo=TRUE}

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(readr);
  library(ggplot2)
})

# read in the data (same as you would a csv)
mlk<-read_lines("data/I_have_a_dream_1963.md")

# this splits the chunk of text into lines
mlk_text <- data_frame(line = 1:length(mlk), text = mlk)

# filter blank lines (even rows)
mlk_text <- mlk_text %>% filter(line %% 2 == 1) %>% 
  mutate(line = 1:nrow(.)) # renumber lines

# Make single word vector
mlk_text<- mlk_text %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

# Now remove all the stop words using an "anti_join"
tidy_mlk <- mlk_text %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

# count the use of each word
tidy_mlk %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) 

# count use and then plot by most to least for words used more than twice in the speech
tidy_mlk %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 2) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="forestgreen") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  theme_bw(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") +
  coord_flip() + labs(x="Words used more than 2x", title="I Have A Dream Speech, MLK Jr. (1963)")
```
