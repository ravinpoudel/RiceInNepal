### Joins

The third tidy data maxim states that each observation type gets its own table. The idea of multiple tables within a dataset will be familiar to anyone who has worked with a relational database but may seem foreign to those who have not. 

The idea is this: Suppose we conduct a behavioral experiment that puts individuals in groups, and we measure both individual- and group-level variables. We should have a table for the individual-level variables and a separate table for the group-level variables. Then, should we need to merge them, we can do so using the `join` functions of `dplyr`. 

The join functions are nicely illustrated in RStudio's [Data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf). Each function takes two data.frames and, optionally, the name(s) of columns on which to match. If no column names are provided, the functions match on all shared column names.

The different join functions control what happens to rows that exist in one table but not the other. 

- `left_join` keeps all the entries that are present in the left (first) table and excludes any that are only in the right table. 
- `right_join` keeps all the entries that are present in the right table and excludes any that are only in the left table.
- `inner_join` keeps only the entries that are present in both tables. `inner_join` is the only function that guarantees you won't generate any missing entries.
- `full_join` keeps all of the entries in both tables, regardless of whether or not they appear in the other table.

# Practice with joins

## Fabricate some example data

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
x <- data.frame(key= LETTERS[c(1:3, 5)], 
                value1 = sample(1:10, 4), 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
y <- data.frame(key= LETTERS[c(1:4)], 
                value2 = sample(1:10, 4), 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

x
y
```

## "Joining" joins

```{r}
# What's in both x and y?
inner_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r}
# What's in X and bring with it the stuff that matches in Y
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r}
# What's in Y and bring with it the stuff that matches in Y
right_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r}
# Give me everything!
full_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

## Filtering "joins"

```{r}
# Give me the stuff in X that is also in Y
semi_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r}
# Give me the stuff in X that is not in Y
anti_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r}
# Want everything that doesn't match?
full_join(anti_join(x,y, by = "key"), anti_join(y,x, by = "key"), by= "key")
```

```{r}
# keys with different names?
x <- data.frame(keyX = LETTERS[c(1:3, 5)], 
                value1 = sample(1:10, 4), 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
y <- data.frame(keyY = LETTERS[c(1:4)], 
                value2 = sample(1:10, 4), 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

x
y
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
full_join(x, y) #should error out
full_join(x, y, by=c("keyX" = "keyY"))
```

# Set Operations
```{r setup_dataframes}
df1 <- data_frame(x = LETTERS[1:2], 
                  y = c(1L, 1L))
df2 <- data_frame(x = LETTERS[1:2], 
                  y = 1:2)

df1
df2
```


```{r}
# Which rows are common in both datasets?
dplyr::intersect(df1, df2)
```

```{r}
#Want all unique rows between both datasets?
dplyr::union(df1, df2)
```

```{r}
#What's unique to df1?
dplyr::setdiff(df1, df2)
```

```{r}
#What's unique to df2?
dplyr::setdiff(df2, df1)
```

# Practice with joins using gapminder

We will practice on our continents data.frame from module 2 and the gapminder data.frame. Note how these are tidy data: We have observations at the level of continent and at the level of country, so they go in different tables. The continent column in the gapminder data.frame allows us to link them now. If continents data.frame isn't in your Environment, load it and recall what it consists of:

```{r}
load('data/continents.RDA')
continents
```

We can join the two data.frames using any of the `dplyr` functions. We will pass the results to `str` to avoid printing more than we can read, and to get more high-level information on the resulting data.frames.

```{r}
left_join(gapminder, continents) 

right_join(gapminder, continents)
```

These operations produce slightly different results, either 1704 or 1705 observations. Can you figure out why? Antarctica contains no countries so doesn't appear in the gapminder data.frame. When we use `left_join` it gets filtered from the results, but when we use `right_join` it appears, with missing values for all of the country-level variables:
  
```{r}
right_join(gapminder, continents) %>% 
  filter(continent == "Antarctica")
```

There's another problem in this data.frame -- it has two population measures, one by continent and one by country and it's not clear which is which! Let's rename a couple of columns.

```{r}
right_join(gapminder, continents) %>% 
  rename(country_pop = pop, continent_pop = population)
```

# Practice with joins using surveys

To illustrate how to use **`dplyr`** with these complex queries, we are going to join
the `plots` and `surveys` tables. The `plots` table in the database contains
information about the different plots surveyed by the researchers.

The datasets can be found here: [plots.csv](data/plots.csv), [surveys.csv](data/surveys.csv), and [species.csv](data/species.csv).

Download them and save them to your downloads folder. Alternatively, copy the link and use the `read_csv()` function directly on that.

```{r plots, results='markup', purl=FALSE}
plots <- read_csv("data/plots.csv")
plots
```

The `plot_id` column also features in the `surveys` table:

```{r surveys, results='markup', purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read_csv("data/surveys.csv")
surveys
```

Because `plot_id` is listed in both tables, we can use it to look up matching
records, and join the two tables.


![diagram illustrating inner and left joins](img/joins.svg)


For example, to extract all surveys for the first plot, which has `plot_id` 1,
we can do:

```{r join, results='markup', purl=FALSE}
plots %>%
  filter(plot_id == 1) %>%
  inner_join(surveys)
```
